      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I'm a passionate frontend developer specializing in modern web
        technologies (Angular & React.js), with a strong focus on creating
        intuitive and high-performance user interfaces. Building scalable
        applications and delivering exceptional user experiences are at the core
        of what I do.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I began my journey in frontend development during my B.Tech years, and
        since then, I've grown into a developer who thrives on solving complex
        challenges. From crafting interactive museum exhibits viewed by
        thousands to developing enterprise-level dashboards that process massive
        amounts of data, I've consistently pushed the boundaries of what's
        possible in web development.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
        contributing to open-source projects, or staying updated with the latest
        frontend trends. I'm particularly enthusiastic about performance
        optimization and creating seamless user experiences that make a real
        impact. My work at Faclon Labs, Tagbin, and other organizations has
        taught me the value of writing clean, maintainable code that scales.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        You can find me sharing tech insights and my development journey on
        GitHub, or connect with me on LinkedIn where I engage with the broader
        developer community.
